## Draft for Visualization of classical graph theory problems

2-3%                 initial planning
20%                 researching requirements and available technology
15-20%         design (ux ui design, uml, requirements, security)
25-30%         implementation
10-15%         evaluation
5%                 reflection, conclusion


The following topics need to be addressed for completion of the project.


### Problems in Graph theories.
Graph theory problems come in various categories such as:
- Traversals and Searches
    - Breadth First Search
    - Depth First Search
- Identification of Spanning trees.
    - Prim's Algorithm
    - Krukshal's Algorithm
- Shortest Paths.
    - Dijkstra's Algorithm
    - Bellman Ford Algorithm
- Graph Coloring.
- Identification of Cliques.
    - Kosarajuâ€™s algorithm
    - Trajan's Strongly Connected Components Algorithms

### Visualization of the graph.
Given a topology described in Json in form of lists or a dictionary, the program should be able to spawn the nodes at
appropriate positions and draw edges between the nodes.

### Visualization of the algorithms
These solution to these problems can be visualized by changing the appearance of the vertices
and the edges while the algorithm is solving the problem iteratively.

#### Object Oriented Design
Vertices and the edges can be introduced in the program as objects having appropriate 
attributes. For the purpose of visualization the attributes could be labels, color, width,
darkness etc.

#### User Interaction
In an advanced version of the project the user may enter (draw) vertices
and edges of his own and run various algorithms on the browser screen.

### Javascript libraries for Visualization.
The proposed libraries for visualizing graphs are as follows:
- Pts.js
- Two.js

### Final Outcome
While the program will run for finding the solution of the problem the appearance of the
graph vertices and edges will change to show the progress of the algorithm, and gain
deeper insights in the working of such algorithms.




project aim u wanna teach someone a new grapgh problem how would you do it like visulising the problem to 
the inv project (building we platform ) functional and non functional methods what tools can be used 

good list of the problems and difficult ones (independent sets hard to explain for an undergrad )
designing teaching aid 


beyond plan dates (weekly ) by end of this too have this
