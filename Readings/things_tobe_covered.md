## Agenda
Visualization of Classical Graph Theory Problems
Explaining and understanding the problem is the most important part of solving it.

## Topics given by the supervisor
- Graph Clouring
- Max k-Cut.
- Min k-partion.
- Independent Set.
- Graph Isomorphism.
- Hamiltonian Cycle.

## Gantt Chart: 24 weeks starting 13 oct 

### Initial Research (Week 1 - 3)
The initial research must be about identifying the topics and understanding and developing a fair amount of confidence in them.
- Identifying the topics.
- Researching about the topics.

### Advanced Research (Week 2 - end)
This will follow the initial research.
- Researching the methodologies to be employed to explain the problems. (The most important thing) (week 5 - end)
- Researching methods to draw graphs on browser. (week 4 - week 6)

### Tasks for the app: (Week 5 - inf)
- Representing graphs in program in a datastructure. (week 6 - week 7)
- Code to spawn graphs. (week 5 - week 10)
- Code for explaining the problems. (week 10 - end)

### Tasks for the report:
- Writing the Abstract of the report. 
- Writing a summary of the topics chosen for the report. (week 4 - week 10)


### Key terms :(week 4- week5)
-Explaining main terms talking about  



## Tentative Topics Chosen:
Graph Isomorphism
Hamiltonian Cycle
Graph Colouring
Indentification of Independent Set
Identification of Cliques in a Graph
Finding Minimum spanning tree in Graph
Finding of Vertex cover

### Graph Isomorphism:
Two graphs G1 and G2 are isomorphic if there is a one-one correspondence between the vertices of G1 and G2 such that the number of edges between any two vertices in G1
is equal to the number of edges joining the corresponding vertices of G2.
Here the graphs may appear to be different in appearance and the labeling of the nodes and edges. But the way one vertex is connected to another in one graph is same
to another. Therefore given two graphs, detecting if the graphs are Isomorphic is a problem to solve.
One way to explain this would be to manipulate the position of vertices and edges to be appear same as it's isomorphic counterpart.
We want to show what isomorphism is.

### Hamiltonian graphs:
Graphs containing walks (moving from one edge to another) that include every vertex exactly once, ending at
initial vertex. (so we should start and end in same point without repeating vertices and cover all the vertices).

Explaination can be given by giving an example graph with a hamiltonian cyle highlighted on it.
We can also give negative examples of paths which are not hamiltonian.

There can also be an Exercise for the user in which she is given a graph and and asked to mark the edges which would make a hamiltonian cycle.
The program should check if that is a hamiltonian cylce by checking if all the related constraints defined in the definition of hamiltonian cycle are
satisfied which are if all the vertices are visited and also that no vertex has been visited twice.
