<h2 id="research">Research</h2>
<h3 id="theoretical-aspects">Theoretical Aspects</h3>
<p>Reading graph theory text books to get abreast with the basic terminology, definitions and<br />
theorems. Graph theory has two aspects. Computational and Mathematical. Exploration of both these aspects should be necessary for completion of this dissertation. Identification of related text books and research papers. Along with the basics, individual graph theory problelms which should be incorporated in the dissertation must be explored in the initial stages of research.</p>
<h3 id="topic-expoloration.">Topic Expoloration.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Identifying suitable graph theory text books and research articles.</li>
<li>Reading graph theory text books to explore graph theory topics (problems).</li>
<li>Determine if a topic can be included in the dissertation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-criteria-of-selection-of-the-topics.">The criteria of selection of the topics.</h3>
<ul>
<li>The topic is interesting for the user.</li>
<li>It has a significant importance in Graph theory.</li>
<li>It has been understood well.</li>
<li>It can be visualised in an interesting way.</li>
<li>Related conceptually with the rest of the topics.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="tentative-topics-chosen">Tentative Topics Chosen:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Graph Isomorphism</li>
<li>Hamiltonian Cycle</li>
<li>Graph Colouring</li>
<li>Indentification of Independent Set</li>
<li>Identification of Cliques in a Graph</li>
<li>Finding Minimum spanning tree in Graph</li>
<li>Finding of Vertex cover</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="once-the-topic-is-identified">Once the topic is identified:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Collect references for the dissertation report.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a short essay with diagrams.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine the ways the topic can be exposited visually. Selection of methods of exposition of a topic is going to be one of the most critical step. It will require the ability to find the best way to get to the heart of the concept of a problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine the medium which can be chosen to deliver the method of exposition.</p>
<ul>
<li>Animations.</li>
<li>User interaction with animations.</li>
<li>Visual interactive exercises.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="programing-aspects">Programing Aspects</h3>
<ul>
<li>Determining the appropriate data structures and functions for internal representation of the graph.</li>
<li>Determining appropriate ways in the chosen programing language to display such representation of graphs on screen.
<ul>
<li>Creation of objects such as vertices and edges at appropriate positions on the screen.</li>
<li>Combining them together to form graph(s).</li>
<li>Moving objects with time for animations.</li>
<li>Changing appearance of different objects with time.</li>
<li>User interaction.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Wireframe: Make a skeleton of the app. A visually appealing front end appropriate for displaying the media along with the explainations.</li>
<li>Determining appropriate ways to navigate from one topic to the next.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="project-management">Project Management</h2>
<ul>
<li>A pert chart must be made which shows the order of different tasks, and which tasks can be scheduled simultaneously.</li>
<li>A weekly journal must be made to record the progress and an agenda for the next week must be proposed.</li>
<li>Weekly meetings with the supervisor for progress update and guidance. Minutes of the meeting should be taken down. Agenda for the next week must be set.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
<h3 id="theoretical-documentation">Theoretical Documentation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Make a database of all the books and research papers referred.</li>
<li>A survey of why graph theory is important in various fields of sciences. (It might go in the introduction of the report as well.)</li>
<li>For each topic chosen, what are there applications and importance in theory, science or engineering.</li>
<li>Formal (Mathematical - Set theoretic syntax) explaination of all the topics discussed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="program-documentation">Program Documentation</h3>
<ul>
<li>The program should be commented in such a way that itâ€™s documentation is auto generated.</li>
<li>A summary of the program in the README of the git repo.</li>
<li>A extended summary of the program for the dissertation report.</li>
</ul>
