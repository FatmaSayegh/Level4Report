<p>2-3% initial planning 20% researching requirements and available technology 15-20% design (ux ui design, uml, requirements, security) 25-30% implementation 10-15% evaluation 5% reflection, conclusion</p>
<p>The following topics need to be addressed for completion of the project.</p>
<h3 id="problems-in-graph-theories.">Problems in Graph theories.</h3>
<p>Graph theory problems come in various categories such as: - Traversals and Searches - Breadth First Search - Depth First Search - Identification of Spanning trees. - Prim’s Algorithm - Krukshal’s Algorithm - Shortest Paths. - Dijkstra’s Algorithm - Bellman Ford Algorithm - Graph Coloring. - Identification of Cliques. - Kosaraju’s algorithm - Trajan’s Strongly Connected Components Algorithms</p>
<h3 id="visualization-of-the-graph.">Visualization of the graph.</h3>
<p>Given a topology described in Json in form of lists or a dictionary, the program should be able to spawn the nodes at appropriate positions and draw edges between the nodes.</p>
<h3 id="visualization-of-the-algorithms">Visualization of the algorithms</h3>
<p>These solution to these problems can be visualized by changing the appearance of the vertices and the edges while the algorithm is solving the problem iteratively.</p>
<h4 id="object-oriented-design">Object Oriented Design</h4>
<p>Vertices and the edges can be introduced in the program as objects having appropriate attributes. For the purpose of visualization the attributes could be labels, color, width, darkness etc.</p>
<h4 id="user-interaction">User Interaction</h4>
<p>In an advanced version of the project the user may enter (draw) vertices and edges of his own and run various algorithms on the browser screen.</p>
<h3 id="javascript-libraries-for-visualization.">Javascript libraries for Visualization.</h3>
<p>The proposed libraries for visualizing graphs are as follows: - Pts.js - Two.js</p>
<h3 id="final-outcome">Final Outcome</h3>
<p>While the program will run for finding the solution of the problem the appearance of the graph vertices and edges will change to show the progress of the algorithm, and gain deeper insights in the working of such algorithms.</p>
