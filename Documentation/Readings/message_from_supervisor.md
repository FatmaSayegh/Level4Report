Visualisation of classical graph theory problems.

Graph theory is a well-established area in discrete mathematics which can be
used to model a lot of practical problems, e.g., wireless networks,
telecommunications, epidemic modelling, matching problems, bioinformatics,
biochemistry, etc. At the heart of graph theory are several fundamental
problems that are used to model the practical applications. For example,
matching, minimum spanning tree, clique, independent set, vertex cover, graph
colouring, graph partitioning, graph isomorphism, etc.

Some of the above problems are hard to solve computationally, which means that
there is no hope of finding an efficient algorithm for all possible instances
of the problem. Several techniques have been adopted to tackle these hard
problems, however, there is always room to do better. The first step towards
solving a problem is thoroughly understanding the problem. Hence, the aim of
this project is to develop a web app that explains a collection of classical
graph problems, with the aid of visualisation.

For inspiration, see http://edge-partitioning.herokuapp.com/ developed by one
of my undergraduate students in the 2021/2022 session. However, note that this
platform explains the steps of an algorithm rather than the problem.
