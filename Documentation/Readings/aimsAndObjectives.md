## Aims and Objectives

### Intrdoduction
There are numerous phenomenon in Science which can be best studied when they are abstracted as graphs.
Graphs can be used to represent a social networks, a biological networks such as protien - protien interaction in
cells, neural networks and ecological networks.

### Aim
The Aim of this project is to develop visual intuition for some of the popular graph theory problems.
Although, in mathematics formal methods are used to describe terms, definitions and theorems. Visual representation
of the concepts can act as an aid to the practioner to enrich his understanding or look at the same concept in a different light.


### Objective
The objective of this project is to create visualization, animation and urer interaction to elucidate the following classical graph
problems.

1. Graph Isomorphism
2. Hamiltonian Cycle
3. Graph Colouring
4. Indentification of Independent Set
5. Identification of Cliques in a Graph
6. Finding Minimum spanning tree in Graph
7. Finding of Vertex cover
8. Max k-Cut
9. Tree Width

To achive this, a website will be created using a functinal programming language called Elm, which transpiles to
front end code in Javascript.
