\section{ Result of Running the Tests.}
\label{testing: results}
The unit and property based testing were done by running the CLI command \emph{elm-test}.
This is a snapshot of the terminal.

\section{Examples of Property Based Testing}
\label{testing: pbtExamples}
The first example checks if a fully connected graph is constructed well by
counting the number of edges which have been formed. The second example
generalizes this to test many types of graphs. Here also the number of edges
formed is compared against the mathematical number of edges which a particular
kind of graph should have.
