Scope of The Project
====================

The project's objective is to visualize graph problems and not to solve
them. Solution of such problems could range from moderately difficult to
very difficult to solve programatically. Therefore in this project,
although the the data type of Graphs (Set of Vertices and Set of Edges)
and the associated functions, are quite general and can support
operations of various kinds, care is taken that we provide the solution
to the visualization program before hand to give enough information to
the animations.
