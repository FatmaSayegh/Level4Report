Whereas, formalism in mathematics gives the subject a structure and a
level of abstraction which makes it applicable to the most general of
the situations. Visualization of a concept on the other hand, restricts
the theory to a particular example but it makes one to see a problem in
a more concrete pattern. It may also allow the learner to see the same
problem in a new light. The learner can then apply or extrapolate the
learning to other instances of the problem in general. In this project
we have tried to elucidate some classical problems in Graph Theory by
the way of visualization on a Web application. The method of
visualization are animations and user interaction with animations. Such
methods, it is belived can help students and self-learners to get
the first brush with the subject of Graph theory.
