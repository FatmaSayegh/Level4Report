The state of
the program and the inputs it recieves are represented by $Types$. The Types
are declared in a modular way in which a larger type represents the model of
the whole of the application. The type situated inside the former represents
the individual pages. The page type itself might be composed of other types
representing various states of the page.

Usually extending the
functionality of the application required one to add a data constructor of a
type or a field in the record of a type alias.
